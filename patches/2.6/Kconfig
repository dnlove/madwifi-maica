	  Say Y here if you intend to attach an Atheros Cardbus or PCI
	  wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.  This
	  driver support the standard Linux Wireless Extensions.

	  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
	  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works:
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called ath_pci.  If unsure, say N.

	  SampleRate chooses the bitrate it predicts will provide the
	  most throughput based on estimates of the expected per-packet
	  transmission time for each bitrate. SampleRate periodically
	  sends packets at bitrates other than the current one to
	  estimate when another bitrate will provide better performance.
	  SampleRate switches to another bitrate when its estimated
	  per-packet transmission time becomes smaller than the current
	  bitrate's. SampleRate reduces the number of bitrates it must
	  sample by eliminating those that could not perform better than
	  the one currently being used. SampleRate also stops probing at
	  a bitrate if it experiences several successive losses.

          Similar to the SampleRate code base, except that it is
          a)more carefully written
          b)shown to give a throughput similar to what can be obtained by
            manually fixing either end to fixed rates
          c)verified by monitoring the network traffic with an ieee80211
             enabled ethereal
          d)responds to network changes and does modify the rate accordingly. 
            Thus, on moving the two nodes together/apart, the ideal rate will 
            be changed as appropriate.
