/*
 * Interface definitions for transmit rate control modules for the
 * Atheros driver.
 *
 * A rate control module is responsible for choosing the transmit rate
 * for each data frame.  Management+control frames are always sent at
 * a fixed rate.
 *
 * An instance of the rate control module is attached to each device
 * at attach time and detached when the device is destroyed.  The module
 * may associate data with each device and each node (station).  Both
 * sets of storage are opaque except for the size of the per-node storage
 * which must be provided when the module is attached.
 *
 * The rate control module is notified for each state transition and
 * station association/reassociation.  Otherwise it is queried for a
 * rate for each outgoing frame and provided status from each transmitted
 * frame.  Any ancillary processing is the responsibility of the module
 * (e.g. if periodic processing is required then the module should setup
 * it's own timer).
 *
 * In addition to the transmit rate for each frame the module must also
 * indicate the number of attempts to make at the specified rate.  If this
 * number is != ATH_TXMAXTRY then an additional callback is made to setup
 * additional transmit state.  The rate control code is assumed to write
 * this additional data directly to the transmit descriptor.
